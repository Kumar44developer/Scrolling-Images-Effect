Scroll Images Animation Project  

This project is a scroll-based image animation built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
As the user scrolls through the page, images smoothly slide into view when they reach a defined viewport threshold and slide out when they leave it.
The animation is triggered dynamically by detecting each image’s position relative to the viewport, creating an engaging and interactive browsing experience.


Key Features:

1. Scroll-triggered image slide-in animations

2. Smooth transitions using CSS

3. Dynamic class toggling with JavaScript

4. Lightweight and library-free implementation

5. Responsive and performance-friendly design

This project is ideal for showcasing modern front-end animation techniques and enhancing visual storytelling on web pages.
